        <p>This is another landing page task for me from <a href="https://iformatlogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iFormatLogic</a>, Blanche is a seller of high quality products made of cotton. This was also made first in Photoshop in which I converted it into HTML and CSS code after.</p>
        <p>I used Avocode to extract the assets from the PSD file for a more accurate recreation of the design with code.</p>

            <h1 class="mt-3 mb-4 mb-lg-5">Objectives & Goals</h1>
            <p>The psd design used a blurred image with the exact same shape as the upper portion of the sofa, thus I knew exactly where area of the hero section image I wanted to blur. I also wanted to practice my absolute positioning skills here as I think it was the best approach with the call to action.</p>

        <p>Time wasn't exactly my friend with this project, so I wanted to try something different. To make room for the hero text, I blurred the top of the sofa using Adobe Photoshop. I also had a ton of revisions of texts being too big, I solved this by using pixels for the font sizes instead of ems.</p>

            <p>I learned how to blur part of an image with Photoshop. I also learned to take a really close look when trying to recreate a PSD design to code, font sizes should always be at an optimal size while still being readable by the majority of your users.</p>
