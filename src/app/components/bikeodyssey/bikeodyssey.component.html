        <p>A landing page task assigned to me during my On-the-Job Training at <a href="https://iformatlogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iFormatLogic</a>, Bike Odyssey is my improvement of the given Motorcycle shop landing page template.</p>

            <p>First off, I wanted the elements to have enough breathing room with one another in order for this project to help convey who I am as a person who enjoys creating aesthetically pleasing User Interfaces.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I wanted to include pictures and techniques that were more modern and attractive than those seen on the template such as making the navigation simpler and placing it inside of a hero section that is also improved, adding a Products section, and adding more known brands in the Partners section.</p>

        <h1 class="mt-3 mb-4 mb-lg-5">Problems Encountered & The Path to Solving them</h1>
        <p>The biggest issues I ran through during the creation of this landing page were numerous edits from my supervisor. My solutions included adjusting section padding, shortening colored lines under the section titles, making a more functional navigation bar, and making cards look more modern.</p>

            <p>This project taught me how to use gradients to make cards with full-sized photos while still making the text inside it readable by contrasting it with the image's black gradient; for me, that was a really useful technique, it's beautiful and effective.</p>
