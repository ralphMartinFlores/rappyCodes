        <p>This is a Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS landing page for the popular coffee shop franchise "But First, Coffee" which originated in Metro Manila and now also has a branch in Olongapo City.</p>
        <p>I personally go to this shop when I want a nice sip of ice cold coffee, and although the main franchise already has a landing page itself, the branch here in our city does not, so I figured why not create one?</p>

            <p>A landing page with more sections was something I really wanted to develop. Additionally, I wanted to experiment with a dark mode color scheme that wasn't actually just a black shade but rather one that would still better represent the company. </p>
            <p>Finally, I was interested in finding out how to upload a static website created with Vanilla HTML and CSS to any free hosting service that is available.</p>

        <p>The hero section of this project went through several iterations; the second and third weren't just satisfying for me.</p>
        <p>The solution to my issue was to use a fresh image from Pexels, icons from Flaticons, overlap those images, and add new quote bubbles to successfully apply the approach that I had just learned from YouTube. After that, I was finally happy with the updated and enhanced hero section. ðŸ˜Š</p>

            <h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 mb-lg-5">Lessons Learned âœ¨</h1>
            <p>Making better hero sections was one of the most significant lessons I took away from this project. As a result of learning a new technique, I believe I can now create better hero sections than I ever could before. </p>
            <p>In order to better understand the BEM methodology, I checked it out once more for writing CSS classes and made the decision to use it more correctly in this project.</p>
            <p>In addition, I used a design technique known as "Neubrutalism," which I believe gives the project a more distinctive personality and creates a stunning contrast between the black borders and the coffee-brown background.</p>
            <p>Oh, and I also got to finally upload a static site for the first time to Netlify.</p>
